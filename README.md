# ufd_prime_generators

In this repository, you can find the prime generators that I created, based on Unique Factorization Domains (UFD).

Trial division and the sieve of Eratosthenes are extended using the following functions:

f(x, y) = x² + xy + Cy² with C = 1,2,3,5,7,11,19,41 <br>
f(x, y) = x² + Cy²2 with C = 1,2 
 
 For the sieve, y = 1.
