# ufd_prime_generators

In this repository, you can find the methods that I created to generate/find prime numbers using polynomials, based on Unique Factorization Domains (UFD).

Trial division and the sieve of Eratosthenes are extended using the following functions:

f(x, y) = x² + xy + Cy² with C = 1,2,3,5,7,11,19,41

f(x, y) = x² + Cy² with C = 1,2 
 
For the extended sieve of eratosthenes, y = 1 must be filled in.
